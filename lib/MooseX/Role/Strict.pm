=head1 NAME

MooseX::Role::Strict - use strict 'roles'

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This code will fail at composition time:

    {
        package My::Role;
        use MooseX::Role::Strict;
        sub conflict {}
    }
    {
        package My::Class;
        use Moose;
        with 'My::Role';
        sub conflict {}
    }

With an error message similar to the following:

    The class My::Class has implicitly overridden the method (conflict) from
    role My::Role ...

To resolve this, explictitly exclude the 'conflict' method:

    {
        package My::Class;
        use Moose;
        with 'My::Role' => { excludes => 'conflict' };
        sub conflict {}
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING>:  this is ALPHA code.  More features to be added later.

When using L<Moose::Role>, a class which provides a method a role provides
will silently override that method.  This can cause strange, hard-to-debug
errors when the role's methods are not called.  Simple use
C<MooseX::Role::Strict> instead of C<Moose::Role> and overriding a role's
method becomes a composition-time failure.  See the synopsis for a resolution.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

=head1 TODO

Add C<includes> to make things easier:

 with 'Some::Role' => { includes => 'bar' };

That reverses the sense of 'excludes' in case you're more interested in the
interface than the implementation.  I'm unsure of the syntax for
auto-converting a role to a pure interface.
